Data Science enthusiast, I have a multidisciplinary background and am interested in the areas of Data Science, development with Python, and Operational Research.
I seek to contribute to research and the creation of solutions for various problems, generating insights that support decision-making.

Bachelor's degree in Naval Sciences from the Naval Academy and a postgraduate degree in Operations and Logistics Management from the Federal University of Rio Grande.
